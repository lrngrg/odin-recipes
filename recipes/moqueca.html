                <li>1 yellow bell pepper, chopped</li>
                <li>1 jalapeno pepper, chopped</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
                <li>2 cups chopped tomatoes</li>
                <li>1/4 cup green onions, chopped</li>
                <li>1 cup of cilantro leaves and tender stems</li>
                <li>1 14 oz can of coconut milk (full fat)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol> 
                <li>Place the fish and shellfish in a large bowl.  Add the minced garlic, and the juice and zest of 
                    one lime.  Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Massage lightly to coat all pieces well, 
                    and set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large pot, heat the coconut oil over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped onion, and cook a few minutes until softened.</li>
                <li>Add the bell peppers, jalapeno, and paprika.  Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper (at least
                    1 tablespoon of salt).  Cook a few minutes longer, until the bell pepper begins to soften.</li>
                <li>Add the tomato paste, and mix evenly through the vegetables.  Stir in the chopped tomatoes and 
                    green onions.  Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.  Stir in the cilantro.</li>
                <li>Nestle the fish and shellfish, along with the garlic and liquid left in the bowl, among the vegetables 
                    so they are lightly covered.</li>
                <li>Pour the coconut milk over the fish and vegetables, and add the fish sauce.  Bring to a simmer
                    and cook for 15 minutes until fish is cooked through.</li>
                <li>Taste and adjust the seasonings.  It is likely you will need to add more salt or lime juice.</li>
                <li>Garnish with cilantro and enjoy with rice!</li>
