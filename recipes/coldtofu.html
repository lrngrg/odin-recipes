            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon douban jiang (spicy bean paste)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 tablespoon scallion, chopped</li>
                <li>1 pound silken tofu</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chopped cilantro or Thai basil (optional)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol> 
                <li>Put the soy sauce, bean paste, sesame oil, and sugar in a small bowl.
                    Add half the garlic and half the scallions.  Mix it all together.
                </li>
                <li>Carefully remove the silken tofu from the package. First, slice the 
                    plastic around the block of tofu, and then use a paring knife to separate 
                    the tofu from the sides of the box. Then turn it over onto the serving bowl. 
                    Slice the tofu crosswise into 1/2 inch thick slices.
                </li>
                <li>Drizzle the sauce over the tofu, and garnish with the rest of the garlic and 
                    scallion on top. You can also garnish with a bit of chopped cilantro and/or 
                    Thai basil. Stir everything together at the table, and enjoy!
