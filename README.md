# odin-recipes
This is my first ever coding project!  It is a basic recipe website made
during the foundations course on the Odin Project.
It consists of a main index page that has a links to a few recipes.
Once completed, it will demonstrate my HTML knowledge, including uses of 
elements and tags, creating lists, and embedding links and images.
